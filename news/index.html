July 5th, 2020<br>
I just changed the homepage from a simple list in the center of the screen to having a new news section in the middle with a sidebar featuring new panels for content! I have also removed the "View Hidden" button in favor of simply moving its only major page, <i>Escape</i>, to the main sidebar. I'm still working on it, so stay tuned!</span>
