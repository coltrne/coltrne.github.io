<dl><dd><b>Shrek</b>: <i>"Once upon a time, there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle, guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from the dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep, in the highest room of the tallest tower, for her true love and true love's first kiss."</i> [Laughing] Like that's ever gonna happen.</dd>

<dd><b>Steve Harwell</b>: ♪ Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me, I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead. The years start comin', and they don't stop comin', fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin', didn't make sense not to live for fun. Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb. So much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with takin' the backstreets. You'll never know if you don't go, you'll never shine if you don't glow. Hey, now, you're an all-star. Get your game on, go play. Hey, now, you're a rock star. Get the show on, get paid. And all that glitters is gold, only shootin' stars break the mold. It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder, you're bundled up now, but wait till you get older. But the meteor men beg to differ judging by the hole in the satellite picture. The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin, the water's getting warm so you might as well swim. My world's on fire, how 'bout yours? That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored. Hey, now, you're an all-star. ♪</dd>

<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Yes, I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you was great back there? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, then bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babies in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: Oh, that's great. Really.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Man, it's good to be free.</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.</dd>
<dd>[Roaring]</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause your breath stinks! Man, you almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time-- [Mumbling] Then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases eking out of my butt that day.</dd>

<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Uh-- Really tall?</dd>

<dd><b>Shrek</b>: That would be my home.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you?</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: I like my privacy.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like, I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You're trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. You know. Can I stay with you?</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: Uh, what?</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Can I stay with you? Please?</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: Of course!</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Really?</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: No.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. Well, maybe you do. But, that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: Okay! Okay! But one night only.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Ah! Thank you!</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: What are you-- No. No.</dd>

<dd><b>Shrek</b>: Oh!</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Where do, uh, I sleep?</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: Outside!</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, I guess outside is best. [Sniffles] Here I go. Good night. [Sighs] I mean, I do like the outdoors.

Please welcome, Cinderella. Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! And last, but certainly not the least, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead, from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But, don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes piña coladas and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Uh, no, not really, no.</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Example?</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: [Sniffs] They stink?</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: Yes-- No!</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: They make you cry?</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: No!</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: You leave them out in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. [Sighs]</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Oh, you both have layers. Oh. [Sniffs] You know, not everybody likes onions. Cakes! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: I don't care what everyone likes. Ogres. Are not. Like cakes.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, "Hey, let's get some parfait," they say, "No, I don't like parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! End of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole dang planet.</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: You know, I think preferred your humming.</dd>

With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that. [Gasps]</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: Donkey, two things, okay? Shut... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.</dd>

<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right? But you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten?</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knows what happens when you find your-- Hey! [Sighs] The sooner we get to Duloc the better.</dd>

<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said.</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: No. I-- I've been this way as long as I can remember.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: It only happens when the sun goes down. "By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm, until you find true love's first kiss, and then take love's true form."</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: It's a spell. [Sighs] When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the sun sets and he sees me, like this. [Sobs]</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: All right, all right. Calm down. Look, It's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24-7.</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: But, Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: But, you know, um, you're kind of an ogre, and Shrek-- well, you got a lot in common.</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: Shrek?</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: Princess, I-- Uh, how's going, first of all? Good? Um, good for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and-- well, I don't really like it, but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd-- uh, uh-- [Sighs] I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, really, who could ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek. My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.</dd>
<dd>[Deep Sigh]</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: Promise you won't tell. Promise!</dd>

<dd><b>Shrek</b>: As promised. Now hand it over.</dd>
<dd><b>Farquaad</b>: Very well, ogre. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, ad agreed. Take it and go before I change my mind. Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I have ever seen such a radiant beauty before. I am Lord Farquaad.</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying, a short, farewell.</dd>
<dd><b>Farquaad</b>: That's so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the ogre. It's not like it has feelings.</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: No, you're right. It doesn't.</dd>
<dd><b>Farquaad</b>: Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage.</dd>
<dd>[Gasps]</dd>
<dd><b>Farquaad</b>: Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?</dd>

<dd><b>Fiona</b>: No! I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today before the sun sets.</dd>
<dd><b>Farquaad</b>: Oh, anxious, are we? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's so much to do! There's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list. Captain, round up some guests!</dd>
<dd><b>Fiona</b>: Fare-thee-well, ogre.</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away.</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: Yeah? So what?</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. I talked to her last night.</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?</dd>
<dd><b>Donkey</b>: Shrek, I-- I wanna go with you.</dd>
<dd><b>Shrek</b>: I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking, Donkeys!</dd>
